# About

## Mittens

Mittens is a modern fork of the original [kubetap](https://github.com/soluble-ai/kubetap) project by Soluble. It has been redesigned to emphasize interactive debugging with mitmproxy's powerful terminal UI.

For more information about the original kubetap project and its development, see [ATTRIBUTION.md](../ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Original Project: Kubetap

Kubetap was built by Matt Hamilton, aka [Eriner](https://github.com/eriner), at [Soluble.ai](https://www.soluble.ai/). There is a [blog post on the Soluble website][building-kubetap] that details the development motivation and implementation of Kubetap.
